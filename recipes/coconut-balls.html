    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>An easy-to-make Hungarian dessert, it doesn't even need cooking or baking.</p>
    <p>Similar to the Swedish chokladboll, but while it has oats, the Hungarian version is made from all purpose (wheat) crackers.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>White crackers (or plain biscuits, whichever name you prefer)</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Milk</li>
        <li>Cocoa powder</li>
        <li>Rum (not much!)</li>
        <li>Shredded coconut</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Pummel the crackers into fine powder (although we can usually just buy the powder version, but what's the fun in that?)</li>
        <li>Mix everything, except the coconut</li>
        <li>Form little balls, usually 3-4 cm in diameter</li>
        <li>Roll the balls in the coconut</li>
        <li>Put it in the fridge for a couple hours! This step is hard, but it's worth it, I promise.</li>
    </ol>
