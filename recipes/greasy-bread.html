    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Yes, I added it for fun, but it's a real thing. And surprisingly good.</p>
    <p>It's much healthier with a lot of vegetables, but if you want to eat healthy, why are you browsing Hungarian recipes?</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Bread</li>
        <li>Animal fat (often pork, but goose or duck is better)</li>
        <li>That's all there is, but if you want, you can make it better with some:
            <ul>
                <li>Red onion (some eat yellow, but trust me, red is better here)</li>
                <li>Salt</li>
                <li>Black pepper</li>
                <li>Powdered paprika</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Put the animal fat on the bread. (Not too much!)</li>
        <li>Add thinly sliced red onion and the seasonings to taste.</li>
        <li>If you want a real Hungarian experience, have some alcohol on the side.</li>
        <li>Cheers!</li>
    </ol>
