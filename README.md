# odin-recipes
The first project in the Foundations course of The Odin Project.  
A few very simple websites, without any CSS or other fancy stuff.

Obviously it was quite easy to do, but still, it felt cool to write some HTML after 4-5 years. Also, even tjat I used git/github before, working with it systematically, doing atomic commits etc. makes a huge difference.
